# UNOCHA Demo Content

Includes demo content pages, and some devel generated content for list pages.

To re-create or add default content the easiest is to add the uuid inside `unocha_demo_content.info.yml` and run `drush dcem unocha_demo_content`

To get the uuid you can use

```bash
drush sqlq "select * from node"
drush sqlq "select * from media"
drush sqlq "select * from file_managed"
drush sqlq "select * from taxonomy_term_data"
drush sqlq "select * from block_content"
drush sqlq "select * from menu_link_content"
```
