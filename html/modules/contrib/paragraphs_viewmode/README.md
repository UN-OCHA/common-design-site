This module contains a behavior plugin for the Paragraphs module. This plugin allows you to select a different view mode for the paragraph in the content add/edit form.

To use this module, go to the paragraph type edit form and enable it. Select which view mode you wish to override, and which view modes you wish to allow overriding to. When adding a paragraph of this type using the experimental paragraph widget, you will have a dropdown box allowing you to select a different display mode. This can be used to control the display of a single paragraph to use different layouts or show different fields without having to create a whole new paragraph type which may collect the same fields.
